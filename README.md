Derricks Code Generator
This was a class Homework assignment to help us develope our skills with javascript
I used html, css and javascript to design a password generator
I styled it with simple colors to make it stand out a bit more so it wasnt just a plain looking webpage
You can click on the generate button and get a code from 1 to 40 letters, numbers and symbols long and there is a previous code section. it also has a copy to clipboard button to make transfering your password easier.
Any advice to make this better is much appriciated and I hope you enjoy.
